   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> (y, callee:y, caller:y) is foreign to the protected tag <TAG> (callee:x) (i.e., it is not a child)
   = help: this foreign write access would cause the protected tag <TAG> (callee:x) (currently Reserved) to become Disabled
   = help: protected tags must never be Disabled
