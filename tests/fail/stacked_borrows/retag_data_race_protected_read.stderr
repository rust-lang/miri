   = help: implicit reads/writes happen on all (re)borrows, as well as when references are copied or moved
   = help: implicit accesses permit optimizations that insert speculative reads or writes
   = help: therefore from the perspective of data races, such accesses have the same implications as a read or write
   = help: Tree Borrows might also perform implicit accesses when returning from a function
   = help: this indicates a bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, and caused Undefined Behavior
   = help: see https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html for further information
   = note: BACKTRACE (of the first span) on thread `unnamed-ID`:

note: some details are omitted, run with `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-backtrace=full` for a verbose backtrace
