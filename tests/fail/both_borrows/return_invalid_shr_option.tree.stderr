   |     ^^^ reborrow through <TAG> is forbidden

   = help: this indicates a potential bug in the program: it performed an invalid operation, but the Tree Borrows rules it violated are still experimental
   = help: the accessed tag <TAG> is a child of the conflicting tag <TAG>
   = help: the conflicting tag <TAG> has state Disabled which forbids this reborrow (acting as a child read access)
help: the accessed tag <TAG> was created here

help: the conflicting tag <TAG> was created here, in the initial state Frozen

   |                             ^^^^^^^^^^
help: the conflicting tag <TAG> later transitioned to Disabled due to a foreign write access at offsets [0x0..0x8]

   = help: this transition corresponds to a loss of read permissions
